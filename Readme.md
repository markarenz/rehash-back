# Re:Hash Backend

## About Re:Hash
Another in a long series of projects that seem to have no discernible meaning or purpose, Re:Hash is a social media
application where users grab short phrases from classic literature and re-hash them into new posts to share with other
users. Basically, it's magnetic poetry with source material cribbed from the likes of Charles Dickens and Emily
Dickinson. 

Even though posting in Re:Hash feels like plagiarism, the posts are thoroughly cited to credit the original authors.
However, if it helps your enjoyment to pretend that using the app is something illicit, please be my guest.

## The Stack
The backend uses Mongo (Atlas) for the database, GraphQL to connect data services to the frontend, and the foundation for the API is Node & Express.

## Starting The API
npm run start
